# Boolean-Expression-Calculator

#### A simpler, user-friendly way to view the truth tables of boolean expressions.

This boolean expression calculator consists of a ReactJS front-end and a Django back-end whose communications are facilitated via API calls. The ReactJS front-end obtains and parses the user input, which is passed to the Django back-end that utilizes Numpy and Pandas to return the resulting logic.

This is inspired by my frustration with online boolean expression calculators and their lack of user-friendliness while studying Computer Science.
